dotfiles repo, to store all config-files for different programs.
For now,
* Neovim,
* tmux,
* iterm2

Basic idea: Migrate all files into dotfiles that can be version-controlled. Then, create a **symlink** to .config, so that when e.g. Neovim looks in .config it points to the file in dotfiles.

Instruction for creating new dotfile that's version-controlled:

`
mkdir -p ~/dotfiles/.config/nvim
`

(-p: parent, ensuring that it also creates intermediary folders that may not exist yet and doesn't throw error)

Moving file from .config:

`
mv ~/.config/[...] ~/dotfiles/.config/
`

Then create symlink:

`
ln -s ~/dotfiles/.config/[...] ~/.config/[...]
`
